			<h2><span>About</span></h2>
			<br>
				<p>
				The WEGC Canteen opened in 1970 and has since become a main fixture of the college. Since the canteen's renovation in 2019 we have installed an industrial tier barista machine to make coffee's (for staff and 				Year 13's and hot chocolates (a student favourite on a rainy day). We have a range of foods and drinks and we know that there is something for everyone here. 
				A favourite of the students as well as staff here at WEGC is the weekly specials, each weekday we have a food and a drink sold together at a discounted rate. We also cater for different events outside of 				school and if you are interested in our catering services you can email Katherine Stokes (contact below).

			<h2>Family</h2>
			
				<p>I was born in Wellington hospital in 2006 and have been living in Wellington ever since. I live with my Mum, Dad and younger sister who has started at Wellington East Girls' College this year. She is really enjoying it so far. My Nana and great Aunty also live in Wellington and my uncle lives in Johnsonville.</p>
				
				
				
			<h2>School</h2>
				<p>I go to Wellington East Girls' College and the compulsory subjects I am taking this year are Mathematics, English and Science. I enjoy all of these subjects because I find them interesting. Especially how recently I have been learning about film techniques in English and I have been learning about biology in Science.</p>
				
				<p>The optional subjects I chose this year are Digital Technology, Applied Business and Chinese. I really enjoyed Digital Technology last year and in 2019 too and I thought that all of these subjects would be useful for the future and interesting to learn about, especially learning how to programme in Digital Technology.</p>
				
			<h2>Why I love Wellington</h2>
				<p>One of the reasons I love Wellington is because of the atmosphere of the city, no matter the time of day, whenever you are in Cuba mall or Lambton Quay, there are always people walking around and I find that it just makes the city feel more alive.</p>
				
				<p>Even the suburbs of Wellington like Island Bay or Miramar always have people around them, one of my favourite memories is when I was scootering with my friend, Mia, along Miramar Peninsula. I love all the beaches in Wellington too. It is nice on a Sunday to sit in the car with music playing while being driven along Oriental Bay and the Miramar Peninsula.</p>
